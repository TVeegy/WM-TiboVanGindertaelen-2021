## 22 Oktober om 22u07 werd deze Repository opgestart!

### 22/10/2020 - avond
- <b>Brainstorm/Cherrypick App-Ideas: 22u10 -> 22u20</b>
  - <b>Mindspacer</b> (some definitions according to myself)
    - A simple-shape visualisation of thoughts, meant to recycle distracting thoughts while working for later use
    - Organiser/retainer of distracting thoughts during times you need to concentrate

- <b>Identify App Keystones: 22u20 -> 22u30</b>
  - A reason to use it during an activity that matters in daily life
  - A purpose that supports a "good" goal
  - Flexibility regarding basic use and/or extensive use (simplicity and extended features/support)
  - Shapes and decorations I can manage in Photoshop myself, vector art for example
  - An opportunity to test out neural networks <i>(provided I can use C#)</i>

### 23/10/2020 - namiddag
-  <b>Setting up .net Hosting (Combell) + Github structuring 14u10 -> 14u35</b>  
-  <b>Github structuring 14u35 -> 15u30</b>  
  - Branches for every project instead of separate repositories
  - Requirement: Pull request from specific branch to master (One-Way manual synchronizing necessary)
  - Problem: Difficult to distinguish repositories in Github Desktop (now only by directory path at mouseover)
