- <b>Mindspacer</b> (some definitions according to myself)
  - A simple-shape visualisation of thoughts, meant to recycle distracting thoughts while working for later use
  - Organiser/retainer of distracting thoughts during times you need to concentrate
- Whats important in an app:
  - A reason to use it during an activity that matters in daily life
  - A purpose that supports a "good" goal
  - Flexibility regarding basic use and/or extensive use (simplicity and extended features/support)
  - Shapes and decorations I can manage in Photoshop myself, vector art for example
  - An opportunity to test out neural networks <i>(provided I can use C#)</i>
